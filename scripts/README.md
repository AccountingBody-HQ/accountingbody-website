# Sanity Migration Scripts

## Before running any script
No setup needed — token loads automatically on terminal start.

## The Six Scripts

### 1 — Wipe Sanity clean
Deletes all articles and practice posts from Sanity and clears the migration logs.
Run this before a fresh migration.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/wipe_sanity.py

### 2 — Run the article migration
Migrates 2,015 WordPress articles to Sanity as article documents.
Currently set to posts[:10] for testing.
Change posts[:10] to posts in the script for the full run.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/migrate_wp_to_sanity.py

### 3 — Run the quiz migration
Migrates 181 WordPress practice question posts to Sanity as practicePost documents.
Currently set to quiz_posts[:5] for testing.
Change quiz_posts[:5] to quiz_posts in the script for the full run.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/migrate_quiz_posts.py

### 4 — Full audit
Checks overall counts and totals against expected values.
Run this after a full migration to verify everything landed.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/audit_sanity.py

### 5 — Per-article audit
Checks every individual article for issues.
Run this after any migration to spot specific problems.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/audit_per_article.py

### 6 — Link authors
Links AccountingBody Editorial Team to all AccountingBody articles.
Links HRLake Editorial Team to all HRLake articles.
Run this after the full migration.

    python3 /workspaces/AccountingBody-Platfrom/scripts/link_author.py
